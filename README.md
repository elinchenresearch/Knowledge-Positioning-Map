# 🧭 Knowledge Positioning Map  
*A structural clarity document for my whole research system*

This repository maps **where my work sits in the global knowledge terrain** — not through affiliations or citations, but through **structural relationships**: what I have **reconstructed**, **rejected**, **absorbed**, or **deflected** in building my **research system**.

It serves as a **clarity tool** for readers, collaborators, and evaluators who may otherwise misread the absence of familiar references as oversight or lack of rigor. This map is deliberately non-academic in format to reflect the architecture of the system it supports.

---

## 📐 Purpose

- To **prevent epistemic misreadings** of my work.
- To **demonstrate deliberate positioning** within (and outside of) existing traditions.
- To serve as a **transparent signal record** of what I know, what I reject, and what I rewire.

## 1. ⚙️ What I Know (Structural Awareness)

A non-exhaustive list of thinkers, domains, or traditions I have structurally interacted with — even if I do not cite them or use their terms.

| Source / Field | Structural Role in My System |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
| Bayesian cognition | Reconstructed under tension-based inference |
| Buddhist logic (non-self, emptiness) | Transduced into signal gating and emotional conversion logic |
| Foucault / Heidegger / Confucian hierarchy | Explicitly deflected via Author Gravity Deflection Register |
| AI alignment / value learning | Bypassed; replaced with structural karma and epistemic responsibility layering |
| Systems theory | Selectively absorbed; internalized under signal gating + karma loops |
| Narrative theory / postcolonial discourse | Traced, but not adopted; my frameworks operate in non-identity logic |

---

## 2. 🛠️ What I Replace (Core Structural Substitutions)

| Domain | Conventional Tool | My System's Replacement |
|--------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Epistemology | Belief, justification | Internal structural coherence, signal integrity |
| Ethics / Blame | Blame-based moral responsibility (focused on individual harm or intent) | Structural karma (natural / structural / personal layers) |
| Emotion modeling | Emotion-as-output or motivation | Emotion-as-system-routing and tension modulation |
| Logical truth | Static propositions | Dynamic theorem system |
| AI reasoning | Statistical inference | Tension-based internal navigation systems |
| Learning theory | Reward-based adaptation | Epistemic self-regulation + loop integrity maintenance |

## 3. 🚫 What I Don’t Use (By Design)

I do not reject these fields out of ignorance or avoidance — I exclude them *because* they distort or block the kind of clarity my system requires.

- Psychoanalysis (Freud, Lacan) — signal entanglement risk  
- Creative theory (Western creativity discourse) — misframes structure as originality  
- Identity-based cultural theory — incompatible with non-fusion emotional systems  
- Symbolic logic — insufficient for dynamic or multi-stable logic states  
- Western "truth" traditions — replaced with motion-consistent structures

## 4. 🧩 Where My Work Interfaces Structurally

This system is designed to operate independently, but can be structurally tested, contrasted, or translated across other domains under controlled framing:

- **Computational inference systems** — to test tension-based models against statistical ones  
- **Collective decision architectures** — to explore karma-layered responsibility models  
- **Ethics and governance infrastructures** — to deploy structural accountability without moral framing  
- **Neuro-symbolic reasoning models** — to evaluate signal logic under multi-stable conditions  
- **Cultural cognition studies** — as contrast environments for non-identity-based emotional routing

## 5. 🔄 Structural Decision Logs (Future)

This section will include time-stamped entries explaining why certain fields were:  
- Rejected (and why)  
- Reabsorbed structurally later  
- Misread and clarified  
- Deliberately suspended for future testing

## 📌 Notes

- This map is **not a bibliography**.  
- It is a **positioning protocol**: one layer of the multi-entry epistemic scaffold.  
- It may evolve — but will never adopt citations for legitimacy.  
- Its function is **clarity**, not compliance.
